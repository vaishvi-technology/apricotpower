                        <p><strong>How We Use Your Phone Number:</strong><br>
                        When you opt in to receive SMS messages from Apricot Power, we use your phone number solely to send you updates about your order, promotional offers, cart reminders, and other marketing communications. Your phone number will not be shared, sold, or disclosed to any unaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes without your explicit consent.</p>

                        Apricot Power does not share SMS opt-in data or consent status with third parties, except as necessary to provide the messaging service (e.g., with our SMS platform provider). We do not sell or share this data with unaffiliated third parties for their own marketing or promotional purposes.</p>

                        <p><strong>Abandoned Cart Disclosure:</strong><br>
                        If you've opted in to receive SMS messages from us and begin the checkout process without completing it, we may use tools such as cookies and plugins to detect cart abandonment. In that case, we may send you a reminder via SMS to return and complete your purchase.</p>

                        <p><strong>Location-Based Services (if applicable):</strong><br>
                        If we collect or use your location data through our mobile services, we will do so only to enhance your experience (e.g., tailoring offers based on your region). This data will not be used or shared without your consent.</p>

                        <p><strong>Your Consent:</strong><br>
                        By opting in to receive SMS messages from Apricot Power, you consent to the use of your phone number and data as described above. You can opt out at any time by replying "STOP" to any message or contacting us directly.</p>

                        <p>If we are processing your personal data for reasons of consent or to fulfil a contract, you can ask us to give you a copy of the information in a machine-readable format so that you can transfer it to another provider.</p>

                        <p>If we are processing your personal data for reasons of consent or legitimate interest, you can request that your data be erased.</p>

                        <p>You have the right to ask us to stop using your information for a period of time if you believe we are not doing so lawfully.</p>

                        <p>Finally, in some circumstances you can ask us not to reach decisions affecting you using automated processing or profiling.</p>

                        <p>To submit a request regarding your personal data by email, mail or telephone, please use the contact information provided above in the <a href="#who-are-we">Who Are We</a> section of this policy.</p>
