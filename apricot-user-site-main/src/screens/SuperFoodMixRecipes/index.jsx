                      <b>Ingredients:</b>
                      <ul>
                        <li>2-3 cups of SuperFood Mix</li>
                        <li>2-3 shredded organic carrots</li>
                        <li>2-3 mashed or blended bananas</li>
                      </ul>
                      <b>Directions:</b>
                      <br />
                      Mix 2-3 cups of SuperFood Mix with 2-3 shredded organic
                      carrots and 2-3 mashed or blended bananas. It should make
                      a thick paste-like mixture. You may need to add a small
                      amount of water, but do so very sparingly. You want the
                      mixture to be similar to pizza dough. Place the thick
                      mixture on counter or cutting board and shape into a
                      flattened rectangle, oval or circle. Pat it down until it
                      is approx ¾ -1" thick. Cut this into strips and place in
                      food dehydrator for 2-6 hours at approx 105-115° F. If you
                      don't have a dehydrator, you can use an oven at the lowest
                      setting keeping the door slightly open to prevent it from
                      getting too hot. The time required will vary, so you'll
                      have to figure what works for your oven. The goal is to
                      keep food temp. below approx 115°F (119°F is generally
                      considered the cut off point for raw).

                      <br />
                      Blend 2-3 cups of mix with about 2-3 cups of water and any
                      additional fruit you'd like (we typically use a couple of
                      bananas, strawberries and/or blueberries but virtually
                      anything will work). If you have an ice cream maker,
                      simply pour the mixture in and turn it on until it gets to
                      the desired consistency. Alternately, you can simply put
                      the mixture into a bowl and stick it in the freezer for
                      1-3 hours until ready.

                      Addition to Many Other Foods: Simply add ¼ cup or more to
                      any of the following foods to boost the nutritional
                      content: yogurt, cottage cheese, cereal, granola, oatmeal,
                      cream of wheat, cream of rice, or just use your
                      imagination then let us know what works.

                      Protein Bars, Energy Bars, Bites, Biscotti's, Brownies,
                      Cakes, Cookies, Cupcakes, Muffins, etc. – The same basic
                      approach works for all the above, simply vary the
                      thickness and type of pan to make the different treats.
                      Use 2-3+ cups of SuperFood Mix, add 2-3 sliced or mashed
                      bananas and 2-3 shredded carrots and mix it all up.
                      Actually, virtually any fruit will work as will a variety
                      of vegetables. Then add approx. ¼ of water for each cup of
                      mix used then mix thoroughly. Add the water slowly, the
                      biggest mistake is to add too much water. Place the mix
                      into the appropriate pan for whatever you'd like it to be
                      &amp; bake at 300°F preheated oven for between 8-35
                      minutes depending on the thickness of the product. Test
                      with toothpick as with any baked item: if it comes out
                      clean it's probably done, if it comes out moist / sticky
                      it isn't. Take out and allow to cool before slicing.

                      Our current favorite way to make baked or dehydrated
                      SuperFood Mix is as little cookies (aka bites). Use a very
                      small ice cream type scoop to form your cookies. We
                      typically leave them rounded but you can smash them flat
                      if you prefer.
