        <label><strong>Directions:</strong></label><br>
        In a sauce pan, add 1-1/2 tsp oil or shortening to 12 oz milk chocolate or dark chocolate chips. Heat on low-medium heat stirring frequently until chocolate pours from the spoon in a thick stream. (Please note, chocolate will hold its form, and yet can be very hot. This is why you must heat for a very short time when using a microwave, and then stir and repeat, it's important that you don't let the chocolate separate.) For dipping white chocolate and butterscotch chips: White and Butterscotch chips only needed 1 tsp oil or shortening per 12 oz. bag. Then follow directions above. When the chocolate is melted, simply dip your cookies however you'd like: half; whole; or just the bottoms or tops. Place dipped cookies on wax paper, sprinkle with nuts or candies and then place in the fridge to set. Remember to occasionally stir the melted chocolate while dipping to keep it at a uniform temperature throughout. You can reheat the chocolate a couple of times. Too many times will separate the chocolate and cause a white skin to form. When that has happened, the chocolate is no longer good for dipping.
